## Description
When setting up a social media app there must be assigned structures as to (1) how the database and relationships are formed and assigned  and (2) routes for backend services to define CRUD methods which will designate how that information is stored and received. This api is designed and setup for future front end assignments for a social media app to designate Users (and friends which refer back to User model) and their thoughts (and reactions which refer back to thoughts model and User field array). You can then utilize the CRUD methods for each of these Models to make new users and thoughts, update their information, or simply delete them from your database once they are no longer in use.

## Installation
Prior to starting this application, you must install MongoDB on your computer (define your environment variables to set the path to the database) and then install the package modules for mongoose and express to utilize these projects by using the commands below:

    npm install express
    npm install mongoose

You can install MongoDB [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Test
To test this application we utilized the Insomnia API and REST client to test out our routes to ensure proper data was being passed through and validations were correct. Each of these routes were tested individually and checked in the database to ensure that all information was being stored and reflecting what was initially sent, updated or deleted.
